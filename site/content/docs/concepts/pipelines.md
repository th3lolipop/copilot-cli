Having an automated release process is one of the most important parts of software delivery, so Copilot wants to make setting up that process as easy as possible ðŸš€.

In this section, we'll talk about using Copilot to set up a CodePipeline that automatically builds your service code when you push to GitHub, deploys to your environments, and runs automated testing.

## Why?

We won't get too philosophical about releasing software, but what's the point of having a release pipeline? With `copilot deploy` you can deploy your service directly from your computer to ECS, so why add a middleman? That's a great question. For some apps, manually using `deploy` is enough, but as your release process gets more complicated (as you add more environments or add automated testing, for example) you want to offload the boring work of repeatedly orchestrating that process to a service. With two services, each having two environments (test and production, say), running integration tests after you deploy to your test environment becomes surprisingly cumbersome to do by hand.

Using an automated release tool like CodePipeline helps make your release manageable. Even if your release isn't particularly complicated, knowing that you can just `git push` to deploy your change always feels a little magical ðŸŒˆ.

## Pipeline structure

Copilot can set up a CodePipeline for you with a few commands - but before we jump into that, let's talk a little bit about the structure of the pipeline we'll be generating. Our pipeline will have the following basic structure:

1. __GitHub Source__ - when you push to a configured branch (main by default), a new pipeline execution is triggered.
2. __Build Stage__ - after your code is pulled from GitHub, your service's container image is built and published to every environment's ECR repository.
3. __Deploy Stages__ - after your code is built, you can deploy to any and all of your environments, with optional post-deployment tests or manual approvals.

Once you've set up a CodePipeline using Copilot, all you'll have to do is push to your GitHub repository, and CodePipeline will orchestrate the deployments.

## Creating a Pipeline in 3 steps
Creating a Pipeline requires only three steps:

1. Preparing the pipeline structure.
2. Committing the generated `buildspec.yml`.
3. Creating the actual CodePipeline.

Follow the three steps below, from your workspace root:

```bash
$ copilot pipeline init
$ git add copilot/buildspec.yml && git commit -m "Adding Pipeline Buildspec" && git push
$ copilot pipeline update
```

âœ¨ And you'll have a new pipeline configured in your application account. Want to understand a little bit more what's going on? Read on!

## Setting up a Pipeline, step by step

### Step 1: Configuring your Pipeline

Pipeline configurations are created at a workspace level. If your workspace has a single service, then your pipeline will be triggered only for that service. However, if you have multiple services in a workspace, then the pipeline will build all the services in the workspace. To start setting up a pipeline, `cd` into your service(s)'s workspace and run:

 `copilot pipeline init`

This won't create your pipeline, but it will create some local files that will be used when creating your pipeline.

* __Release order__: You'll be prompted for environments you want to deploy to - select them based on the order you want them to be deployed in your pipeline (deployments happen one environment at a time). You may, for example, want to deploy to your `test` environment first, and then your `prod` environment.

* __Tracking repository__: After you've selected the environments you want to deploy to, you'll be prompted to select which GitHub repository you want your CodePipeline to track. This is the repository that, when pushed to, will trigger a pipeline execution. (If the repository you're interested in doesn't show up, you can pass it in using the `--github-url` flag.)

* __Personal access token__: In order to allow CodePipeline to track your GitHub repository, you'll need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token. You can read how to do that [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Your token needs to have _repo_ and _admin:repo_hook_ permissions (so CodePipeline can create a WebHook on your behalf). Your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored securely in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

### Step 2: Updating the Pipeline manifest (optional)

Just like your service has a simple manifest file, so does your pipeline. After you run `pipeline init`, two files are created, the `pipeline.yml` and `buildspec.yml`, both created in your `copilot/` directory. If you poke in, you'll see a file that looks something like this (for a service called "api-frontend" with two environments, "test" and "prod"):

```yaml
# This YAML file defines the relationship and deployment ordering of your environments.

# The name of the pipeline
name: pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend

# The version of the schema used in this template
version: 1

# This section defines the source artifacts.
source:
  # The name of the provider that is used to store the source artifacts.
  provider: GitHub
  # Additional properties that further specifies the exact location
  # the artifacts should be sourced from. For example, the GitHub provider
  # has the following properties: repository, branch.
  properties:
    access_token_secret: github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend
    branch: main
    repository: https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend

# The deployment section defines the order the pipeline will deploy
# to your environments.
stages:
    - # The name of the environment to deploy to.
      name: test
      test_commands:
        - make test
        - echo "woo! Tests passed"
    - # The name of the environment to deploy to.
      name: prod
      # requires_approval: true
```

There are 3 main parts of this file, the name field, which is the name of your CodePipeline, the source section, which details the GitHub repository and branch to track, and the stages section, which lists the environments you want this pipeline to deploy to. You can update this any time, but you must run `copilot pipeline update` afterwards.

Typically, you'll update this file if you add new environments you want to deploy to, or want to track a different branch.

### Step 3: Updating the Buildspec (optional)

Along with the `pipeline.yml`, the `pipeline init` command also generated a `buildspec.yml` file in the `copilot/` directory. This contains the instructions for building and publishing your service. If you want to run any additional commands, besides `docker build`, such as unit tests or style checkers, feel free to add it to the buildspec's `build` phase.

When this buildspec runs, it pulls down the version of Copilot which was used when you ran `pipeline init`, to ensure backwards compatibility.


### Step 4: Creating your Pipeline

Now that your `pipeline.yml` and `buildspec.yml` are created, check them in and push them to your GitHub repository. The `buildspec.yml` is needed for your Pipeline's build stage to run successfully. Once you've done that, to actually create your pipeline run:

`copilot pipeline update`

This parses your `pipeline.yml`, creates a CodePipeline in the same account and region as your project (though it can deploy cross-account and cross-region) and kicks off a pipeline execution. Log into the AWS Console to watch your Pipeline go.

## Adding Tests

Of course, one of the most important parts of a pipeline is the automated testing. To add your own test commands, include the commands you'd like to run after your deploy step in the `test_commands` section. If all the commands succeed, your change is promoted to the next stage. 

Adding `test_commands` generates a CodeBuild project with the [aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:3.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html) image - so most commands from Amazon Linux 2 (including `make`) are available for use. 

In the example below, the pipeline will run `make test` command (in your source code directory) and only promote the change to the prod stage if that command exits successfully. 

```yaml
name: pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend
version: 1
source:
  provider: GitHub
  properties:
    access_token_secret: github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend
    branch: main
    repository: https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend

stages:
    -
      name: test
      # A change will only deploy to the production stage if the
      # make test and echo commands exit successfully. 
      test_commands:
        - make test
        - echo "woo! Tests passed"
    -
      name: prod
```
